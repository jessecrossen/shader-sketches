Shader Sketches by Jesse Crossen
--------------------------------

These are some whimsical animations that I'm 
fooling around with as an excercise in learning 
[GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language).
If your browser supports WebGL, 
[you can look at them here](https://jessecrossen.github.io/shader-sketches/).

Rendering is handled by [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas).
I've been educated and inspired by 
[The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/).
